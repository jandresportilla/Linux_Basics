What is a Shell Script?

A shell script is an executable file containing multiple shell commands that are executed sequentially. 
The file can contain:

Shell  (#!/bin/bash)
Comments (# comments)
Commands (echo, cp, grep, etc...)
statements (if, while, for...)


Shell script should have executable permissions
Shell script has to be called from absolute path (e.g  /home/userdir/script.bash)
If called from current location then ./script.bash
